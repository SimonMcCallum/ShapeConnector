# ShapeConnector  

### A puzzle game. Play at [shapeconnector.com](http://shapeconnector.com)!


## The rules

It's simple get from Point A to Point B in exactly N moves. 

But, the caveat is that you can only move up, down, left, or right. 
Also, you can only move to a shape that is the same color (red, green, blue, yellow) and/or type (square, diamond, triangle, circle).

## The implementation
### Status: In Progess

The game is built using Angular, and all of the game elements are rendered on canvases.

I used the yo [gulp anuglar generator](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular) to setup the general strucutre for the app, and made minor modifications to support the folder & naming structure that I prefer.

The app is written in coffeescript and the styles use scss.

The app was designed in sketch, and if you'd like to view the comp its available here: [ShapeConnector sketch file](https://github.com/thalida/ShapeConnector/blob/master/shapeconnector.sketch). The comp lays out my end goal plans for the core app.


## Future additions
Checkout the [open issues](https://github.com/thalida/ShapeConnector/issues) for the enhancments, features, and bugs of the game. You can track the issues via github or the [waffle board](https://waffle.io/thalida/ShapeConnector).


## Contributing
So, I'm currently **not accepting pull requests** on the game. Once the core features of the game are completed. I'll offically open things up for other
developers to enhance and hack on.

I'm keeping the project public though just as a reference for code, and also
allows other developers to fork and hack on the current project.

Once I _fully_ open the game, I'll update the LICENSE.txt, as well as add
a CONTRIBUTING.txt, and a wiki which will over running the game locally for
development.


## License
None at the moment, I'll udpate with the approriate license after I finish the core game.
