### A puzzle game. Play at [shapeconnector.com](http://shapeconnector.com)!

ShapeConnector is a simple puzzle game, where the goal is to get from Point A to Point B in exactly X number of moves.

The caveat: you're only allowed move up, down, left, or right, and only to a shape that is the same color (red, green, blue, yellow) and/or type (square, diamond, triangle, circle).

## The implementation

The game is developed using Angular, and is built by Webpack. All of the game elements are rendered on HTML5 canvases. In addition, it's written in CoffeeScript and the styles use SCSS. You can play the game offline through the use of ServiceWorkers.
