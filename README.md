## The rules

It's simple: get from Point A to Point B in exactly X number of moves. 

The caveat: you can only move up, down, left, or right, and only to a shape that is the same color (red, green, blue, yellow) or type (square, diamond, triangle, circle).

## Contributing
So, I'm currently **not accepting pull requests** on the game. Once the core features of the game are completed. I'll offically open things up for other
developers to enhance and hack on.

I'm keeping the project public though just as a reference for code, and also
allows other developers to fork and hack on the current project.

Once I _fully_ open the game, I'll update the LICENSE.txt, as well as add
a CONTRIBUTING.txt, and a wiki which will over running the game locally for
development.


## License
None at the moment, I'll udpate with the approriate license after I finish the core game.
